# `BackupManager` Class Documentation

## Overview
The `BackupManager` class is designed to provide an automated way of backing up an SQLite database to a specified file. The backup process involves extracting the database schema and data, and then writing it into a file in SQL format. This can later be used to restore the database or to transfer the database structure and content.

The class generates:
1. **Schema** - `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables in the database.
2. **Data** - `INSERT INTO` statements for all data in the tables.

The process is logged for tracking purposes and to provide details for any potential errors that occur.

## Class Components

### 1. Logger Setup
The class uses a `Logger` for tracking important events and errors. The logger is configured to log events at different stages of the backup process.

```java
private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(BackupManager.class.getName());
```

---

## Methods

### 1. `backupDatabase(String backupFilePath)`
**Description**:  
This method is responsible for managing the entire backup process. It connects to the database, retrieves all table schemas, and writes both the schema and the data to a backup file.

**Parameters**:
- `backupFilePath` (String): The path where the backup file will be stored, including the file name (e.g., `backups/BackUP.db`).

**Returns**:  
- `void`

**Usage**:
```java
BackupManager.backupDatabase("path/to/backup/file");
```

#### Method Workflow:
1. **Log the Database Path**:  
   Logs the path of the database being backed up.

2. **Check Database File**:  
   Verifies if the database file exists and is a valid file. If not, it logs an error and terminates the method.

3. **Establish Connection**:  
   Attempts to establish a connection to the database using the `Database.getConnection()` method. If the connection fails, it logs an error.

4. **Create Backup File**:  
   Creates a backup file (if it doesn't exist) and starts writing to it using a `BufferedWriter`.

5. **Write Schema and Data**:
   - **Write Schema**:  
     For each table, it retrieves and writes the schema (`CREATE TABLE` statement) using the `writeTableSchema` method.
   - **Write Data**:  
     For each table, it retrieves the data and writes `INSERT INTO` statements using the `writeTableData` method.

6. **Completion**:  
   After completing the backup, it logs the success message.

#### Error Handling:
- Logs errors related to database connection issues, missing files, or IO failures.

### 2. `writeTableSchema(String tableName, Connection conn, BufferedWriter writer)`
**Description**:  
This method writes the SQL schema (the `CREATE TABLE` statement) for a specific table to the backup file.

**Parameters**:
- `tableName` (String): The name of the table whose schema is to be written.
- `conn` (Connection): The active connection to the SQLite database.
- `writer` (BufferedWriter): The `BufferedWriter` instance used to write the schema to the backup file.

**Returns**:  
- `void`

**Throws**:  
- `SQLException`: If there is an error retrieving the table schema from the database.
- `IOException`: If there is an error writing to the backup file.

#### Method Workflow:
1. Prepares an SQL query to retrieve the schema for the specified table (`SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = 'table'`).
2. Executes the query using a `PreparedStatement`.
3. Writes the schema to the backup file in the format of a `CREATE TABLE` statement.

---

### 3. `writeTableData(String tableName, Connection conn, BufferedWriter writer)`
**Description**:  
This method writes the data of a given table as `INSERT INTO` statements into the backup file.

**Parameters**:
- `tableName` (String): The name of the table whose data is to be written.
- `conn` (Connection): The active connection to the SQLite database.
- `writer` (BufferedWriter): The `BufferedWriter` instance used to write the data to the backup file.

**Returns**:  
- `void`

**Throws**:  
- `SQLException`: If there is an error retrieving the table data.
- `IOException`: If there is an error writing to the backup file.

#### Method Workflow:
1. Executes an SQL query (`SELECT * FROM tableName`) to retrieve all rows from the specified table.
2. Iterates through the `ResultSet` and constructs an `INSERT INTO` statement for each row.
3. Writes each `INSERT INTO` statement into the backup file, ensuring that special characters in data (like single quotes) are properly escaped.

---

### 4. `main(String[] args)`
**Description**:  
The `main` method provides a simple entry point for running the backup operation. It demonstrates the process of backing up the database to a predefined file path.

**Parameters**:  
- `args` (String[]): Command-line arguments (unused in this method).

**Returns**:  
- `void`

**Usage**:  
```java
BackupManager.main(null);
```

---

## Logging
The class utilizes the `Logger` object to log all significant actions and errors throughout the backup process. This includes:
- **Starting the backup**: Logs the attempt to back up the database.
- **Database file validation**: Logs errors when the database file is missing or invalid.
- **Connection attempt**: Logs success or failure of the database connection.
- **Table backup process**: Logs each table that is being backed up.
- **Error logging**: Logs any failures related to file writing or SQL errors.

Example log messages:
```
INFO: Attempting to back up database at: /path/to/database.db
SEVERE: Database file does not exist or is not a valid file: /path/to/database.db
INFO: Backing up table: users
INFO: Database backup completed successfully.
```

---

## Error Handling
The `BackupManager` class is designed to handle errors gracefully. The errors are captured and logged without terminating the program abruptly. If an error occurs:
- The process logs the error message for debugging.
- The method gracefully returns without performing any further actions.

Common errors include:
- **Database connection issues**: If `Database.getConnection()` fails.
- **File access issues**: If the backup file path is invalid or inaccessible.
- **SQL errors**: If an issue arises during schema or data retrieval.

---

## How to Use

### 1. Setup the Database
Ensure that the `Database` class is properly configured and provides a valid SQLite connection using the `Database.getConnection()` method.

### 2. Call the Backup
Invoke the `BackupManager.backupDatabase()` method, passing the desired backup file path as a parameter.

Example:
```java
BackupManager.backupDatabase("path/to/backup/file");
```

### 3. File Location and Permissions
Ensure that the backup file path is accessible and writable. The method will attempt to create the file if it does not exist, but the directory must be writable. The application also needs the necessary permissions to read the database file and write the backup file.

---

## Example Usage

Here’s an example of how to use the `BackupManager` class to back up the database:

```java
package database;

public class DatabaseBackupExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the path to the backup file
        String backupFilePath = "backups/DatabaseBackup.db";
        
        // Perform the backup
        BackupManager.backupDatabase(backupFilePath);
    }
}
```

This example will back up the database to the file `DatabaseBackup.db` inside the `backups` directory.

---

## Additional Notes:
- The backup file will contain SQL statements (`CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`) that can be executed to recreate the database schema and populate it with data.
- Ensure the path provided for the backup file is writable by the application.
- The `BackupManager` class currently does not support incremental backups, meaning it always backs up the entire database.

---

## Conclusion:
The `BackupManager` class is a simple and effective tool for backing up an SQLite database in SQL format. It offers an easy-to-use interface for developers and provides useful logging for debugging. The generated backup files can be used for database migration or restoration.

By following the usage instructions, developers can integrate this functionality into their own applications to provide automated database backups.
